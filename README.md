Nutrient Dose Interpolation

## Description

The objective of this project is to develop an open-source web application that allows users to spatially interpolate nutrient levels—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)—across agricultural plots.
Users can upload spatial and tabular data and receive interpolated results visualized on an interactive map, along with downloadable output maps.
